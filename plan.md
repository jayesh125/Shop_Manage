To build a shop management tool with Django and a frontend framework, here’s a step-by-step plan you can follow. This includes your core requirements and a few additional enhancements to make the tool more robust and scalable.

### 1. **Project Setup**
   - **Backend (Django)**: 
     - Set up a Django project.
     - Create necessary apps for **billing**, **products**, and **categories**.
   - **Frontend Framework (Optional)**: Choose a modern frontend framework (React, Vue.js, or Angular).
   - Set up a virtual environment and install required dependencies (Django, Django REST Framework, etc.).

### 2. **User Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement user registration and authentication using Django's built-in system.
   - Use `django.contrib.auth` for handling roles, allowing for admin and shop manager roles with different privileges.
     - **Admin** can manage all products and categories.
     - **Shop Manager** can generate bills and manage the product catalog.
     Since you prefer to avoid using multiple roles, we can simplify the user management system. Here's an updated plan for **User Authentication** and related management:

#### a. **User Registration and Authentication**:
   - Use Django’s built-in user authentication system (`django.contrib.auth`) for basic user login and registration.
   - Allow users to manage the entire tool without separate roles.
   - Implement email verification for added security and reliability.
   - Create a simple user profile where they can update personal information (e.g., name, email).
   - Allow the user to change their password or reset it via email.


### 3. **Product & Category Management**
   - **Product Model**:
     - Fields: name, price, description, SKU, category, available stock, GST applicable (boolean).
   - **Category Model**:
     - Allow users to create their own categories dynamically.
     - Fields: name, description, parent category (optional for subcategories).
   - Build API endpoints for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for both products and categories.

### 4. **Billing System**
   - **Bill Generation**:
     - Users can add multiple products to a bill.
     - Calculate GST automatically based on predefined rates (CGST, SGST, IGST).
     - Allow users to apply discounts.
   - **Auto-Generated Bill Number**:
     - Create a system that generates unique bill numbers.
   - **Bill Model**:
     - Fields: bill number, customer details, list of products (foreign key), total amount, date of creation, payment status.
   - **Print Bill**:
     - Use a third-party package like `xhtml2pdf` to convert the bill into a printable PDF format.
   - Create API endpoints to generate, retrieve, and print bills.

### 5. **GST Calculation & Display**
   - Add support for GST breakdown in billing:
     - Show GST in the final bill (CGST, SGST, or IGST based on the location).
     - Handle exemptions if certain products are not GST applicable.
   - Display total tax amount and grand total after tax.
   - Ensure GST compliance by allowing easy updates to GST rates.

### 6. **Inventory Management (Auto-Update)**
   - Automatically update product inventory when a bill is generated.
     - Deduct sold product quantities from available stock.
   - Trigger notifications or alerts when stock falls below a defined threshold.

### 7. **Reports & Analytics (Optional but Valuable)**
   - Provide users with reports on:
     - Total sales within a given period.
     - GST collected.
     - Best-selling products.
   - Create API endpoints to export data in CSV or Excel formats.

### 8. **Frontend (Optional)**
   - Create an intuitive UI where users can:
     - Add products to a bill easily.
     - Manage product inventory and categories.
     - View reports and bills.
   - Use React, Vue.js, or Angular to create a dynamic and responsive interface.
   - Connect the frontend with the Django backend using REST API.

### 9. **Deployment & Security**
   - **Deployment**:
     - Use Docker for containerization and easy deployment.
     - Host the application on a cloud provider (AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.).
   - **Security**:
     - Ensure sensitive data (e.g., billing details) is secured using HTTPS and Django’s security best practices.
     - Implement CSRF protection, use Django's security middleware, and manage user sessions securely.

### Additional Features:
   - **Multi-Shop Support** (Optional): If you want scalability, allow the application to support multiple shops with unique inventories and billing systems.
   - **User Permissions**: Fine-tune access controls so that shop managers can only view/edit their own shop’s data.


# New Features and Updation

It sounds like your application is coming together well! To build a truly exceptional tool for shop managers, here are a few suggestions to elevate its functionality and usability:

### 1. **Enhanced Reporting Dashboard**
   - **Key Metrics**: Add a dashboard to display important statistics like total sales, profit margins, outstanding payments, top-selling products, etc.
   - **Date Range Filters**: Let users filter reports by day, week, or custom date ranges.
   - **Visualization**: Use charts and graphs to make data more intuitive (e.g., bar charts for sales, pie charts for product categories).

### 2. **Inventory Management System**
   - **Stock Tracking**: Track inventory levels for each product, and give alerts when stock is low.
   - **Automated Stock Updates**: Automatically update inventory when products are added to a bill.
   - **Reordering System**: Suggest products that need reordering based on past sales trends and current stock levels.

### 3. **User Roles and Permissions**
   - You can add different permission levels such as shop owner, manager, or sales staff to control access to different features. Even though you said you don't need multiple roles, defining them later can make the tool scalable for larger businesses.

### 4. **Customer Engagement Tools**
   - **Loyalty Programs**: Offer loyalty points for customers based on the number of purchases or amounts spent.
   - **Customer Insights**: Provide shop owners with insights into customer purchase behavior, such as frequent buyers or the products they usually purchase.
   - **Notification System**: Send automatic email or SMS notifications for things like outstanding bills, discounts, or promotional offers.

### 5. **Mobile Compatibility**
   - Ensure the web app is mobile-responsive or consider building a simple mobile app to allow shop managers to access key features on the go.

### 6. **Improved Search & Filtering**
   - Add advanced search and filtering options for managing products, customers, and bills. Allow users to search across multiple fields (e.g., search for bills by product name, customer name, or date).

### 7. **Automated Tax Calculation Updates**
   - Allow shop managers to update GST and tax rates as regulations change, and automatically apply these to new bills.

### 8. **Data Backup & Security**
   - Implement daily or weekly backups of critical data like bills, customer information, and product stock.
   - Consider adding encryption for sensitive data (e.g., customer payment info).

### 9. **Third-Party Integrations**
   - Add integrations with accounting software (like QuickBooks or Zoho Books) for better financial management.
   - Integrate with payment gateways to allow customers to make online payments.
