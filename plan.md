To build a shop management tool with Django and a frontend framework, here’s a step-by-step plan you can follow. This includes your core requirements and a few additional enhancements to make the tool more robust and scalable.

### 1. **Project Setup**
   - **Backend (Django)**: 
     - Set up a Django project.
     - Create necessary apps for **billing**, **products**, and **categories**.
   - **Frontend Framework (Optional)**: Choose a modern frontend framework (React, Vue.js, or Angular).
   - Set up a virtual environment and install required dependencies (Django, Django REST Framework, etc.).

### 2. **User Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement user registration and authentication using Django's built-in system.
   - Use `django.contrib.auth` for handling roles, allowing for admin and shop manager roles with different privileges.
     - **Admin** can manage all products and categories.
     - **Shop Manager** can generate bills and manage the product catalog.
     Since you prefer to avoid using multiple roles, we can simplify the user management system. Here's an updated plan for **User Authentication** and related management:

#### a. **User Registration and Authentication**:
   - Use Django’s built-in user authentication system (`django.contrib.auth`) for basic user login and registration.
   - Allow users to manage the entire tool without separate roles.
   - Implement email verification for added security and reliability.
   - Create a simple user profile where they can update personal information (e.g., name, email).
   - Allow the user to change their password or reset it via email.


### 3. **Product & Category Management**
   - **Product Model**:
     - Fields: name, price, description, SKU, category, available stock, GST applicable (boolean).
   - **Category Model**:
     - Allow users to create their own categories dynamically.
     - Fields: name, description, parent category (optional for subcategories).
   - Build API endpoints for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for both products and categories.

### 4. **Billing System**
   - **Bill Generation**:
     - Users can add multiple products to a bill.
     - Calculate GST automatically based on predefined rates (CGST, SGST, IGST).
     - Allow users to apply discounts.
   - **Auto-Generated Bill Number**:
     - Create a system that generates unique bill numbers.
   - **Bill Model**:
     - Fields: bill number, customer details, list of products (foreign key), total amount, date of creation, payment status.
   - **Print Bill**:
     - Use a third-party package like `xhtml2pdf` to convert the bill into a printable PDF format.
   - Create API endpoints to generate, retrieve, and print bills.

### 5. **GST Calculation & Display**
   - Add support for GST breakdown in billing:
     - Show GST in the final bill (CGST, SGST, or IGST based on the location).
     - Handle exemptions if certain products are not GST applicable.
   - Display total tax amount and grand total after tax.
   - Ensure GST compliance by allowing easy updates to GST rates.

### 6. **Inventory Management (Auto-Update)**
   - Automatically update product inventory when a bill is generated.
     - Deduct sold product quantities from available stock.
   - Trigger notifications or alerts when stock falls below a defined threshold.

### 7. **Reports & Analytics (Optional but Valuable)**
   - Provide users with reports on:
     - Total sales within a given period.
     - GST collected.
     - Best-selling products.
   - Create API endpoints to export data in CSV or Excel formats.

### 8. **Frontend (Optional)**
   - Create an intuitive UI where users can:
     - Add products to a bill easily.
     - Manage product inventory and categories.
     - View reports and bills.
   - Use React, Vue.js, or Angular to create a dynamic and responsive interface.
   - Connect the frontend with the Django backend using REST API.

### 9. **Deployment & Security**
   - **Deployment**:
     - Use Docker for containerization and easy deployment.
     - Host the application on a cloud provider (AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.).
   - **Security**:
     - Ensure sensitive data (e.g., billing details) is secured using HTTPS and Django’s security best practices.
     - Implement CSRF protection, use Django's security middleware, and manage user sessions securely.

### Additional Features:
   - **Multi-Shop Support** (Optional): If you want scalability, allow the application to support multiple shops with unique inventories and billing systems.
   - **User Permissions**: Fine-tune access controls so that shop managers can only view/edit their own shop’s data.
